=================

To read logs, LogInsight requires `android.permission.READ_LOGS`. As of Android 4.2 this is a protected permission. The permission will be automatically granted on rooted devices, otherwise you may grant it manually by running `adb shell pm grant com.vmware.loginsight android.permission.READ_LOGS`.
